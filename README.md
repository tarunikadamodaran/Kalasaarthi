KalaSaarthi
An AI-powered marketplace designed to bridge the digital divide for traditional artisans by simplifying online selling through generative AI and a dual-interface platform.

About
KalaSaarthi is a project designed to integrate a generative AI engine within a dual-interface e-commerce platform. Traditional artisan marketplaces often fail rural creators due to complex onboarding, language barriers, and the need for digital marketing skills. This project seeks to overcome these challenges by creating an easy-to-use seller dashboard where artisans can upload a photo and speak a story in their native language, which the AI then converts into a professional, SEO-optimized product listing.

Features
Generative AI Integration: Implements Google Gemini API for automated content generation (titles, descriptions, tags).

Dual-Interface System: Distinct, optimized dashboards for Sellers (Artisans) and Buyers (Consumers).

Real-time Synchronization: Built on Firestore for instant inventory updates across all users.

Multilingual Support: Full support for English, Hindi, and Tamil input and output.

Zero-Code Onboarding: A specific scope of simplified UI to ensure usability for non-tech-savvy users.

Requirements
Operating System: Requires a modern OS (Windows 10/11, macOS, or Linux) for development; accessible via any web browser on mobile/desktop.

Development Environment: Node.js environment or a simple local server for hosting the web app.

Generative AI: Google Gemini API key is necessary for the content generation module.

Backend as a Service: Firebase project setup (Authentication and Firestore) is essential for data management.

Version Control: Implementation of Git for collaborative development and effective code management.

IDE: Use of VSCode as the Integrated Development Environment for coding, debugging, and version control integration.

Additional Dependencies: Includes Chart.js for analytics visualization and Tailwind CSS for styling.
